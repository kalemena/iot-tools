OneWire and Dallas libraries required to read DS18B20 sensor.

This is possible to wire several sensors together (not explained here).

Sketches to try this in example from libraries to install:

* link:/libs/DallasTemperature.zip[Dallas Temperature]
* link:/libs/OneWire.zip[One Wire]


== DHT22

Temperature and humidity sensor.

[NOTE]
====
For some reasons, the jeelib driver library didn't work using above wiring.

== SHT11

Temperature and humidity sensor.

Usage of Jeelib as driver.


== BMP85

Temperature and pressure sensor.

[TODO]


== HTU21D

Temperature and humidity sensor.

This is standard i2c wiring.
