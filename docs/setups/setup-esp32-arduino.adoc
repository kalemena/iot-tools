= Setup Arduino IDE for ESP32
:hardbreaks:

This is very similar to link:/docs/setups/setup-esp8266-arduino.adoc[ESP8266 setup].

== Hardware

These work good:

- Lolin 32S

- Wemos 32 (clone of Wemos D1 Mini but with ESP32 instead of ESP8266)
link:https://github.com/r0oland/ESP32_mini_KiCad_Library[Board details]

- TTGO (the one which has a camera)

== Procedure

- Import ESP32 Board into Arduino IDE by adding URL into Settings:
  
  https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

- Load the Libraries for ESP32 from panel Board Manager.

- Load sample _hello_ app into NodeMCU-32S

In Arduino IDE, select proper board, example:
- Tools/Cards/NodeMCU 32S board
- <correct USB device>

Create sketch such as the link:/sketches/esp8266-led/esp8266-led.ino[ESP8266 LED]

[source,js]
----
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin 2 as an output.
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}
----

LED should blink as shown below:
