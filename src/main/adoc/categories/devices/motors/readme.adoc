= Devices - Motors

== Notes

Most Servo motors can rotate only 90°.
Some, like FS90R, can rotate continuously with 360°. 
However 360° seems cannot be precise because command are only about forward/stop/backward, versus other servo which have commands 0° to 90°.

== Example

.Basic Code
[source,c]
----
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(D6);
}

void loop() {
  myservo.write(45); // Rotate at 45°
}
